"# roguelike-project" 

This Roguelike Project is based on the 13 part Roguelike Tutorial Revised at http://rogueliketutorials.com/

To run this Roguelike on your Windows machine you will need:
1. Python version 3.5 or higher found here: https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. The latest version of the TCOD library. Installation instructions can be found here: https://python-tcod.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html
3. A virtual environment to run Python and TCOD in. Python 3 comes bundled with the venv module to create virtual environments. See "Create an environment" and "Activate the environment" sections from here: https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/installation/
3A. If you received an error that says you cannot run scripts on your machine you can find the workarounds [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_execution_policies?view=powershell-7). You need to set the Execution Policy to AllSigned, to do this you will need to run powershell as administrator.
3B. Run the game with `$ python engine.py`
3C. After running the game, it would be wise to set execution policies back to the default or restricted. 
4. Visual Studio Code which can be found here:https://code.visualstudio.com/
